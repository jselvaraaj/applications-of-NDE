# Application of Neural Differential Equations
This repository explores the use of **Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs)** to model degenerated markov process in model-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) as part of my undergraduate thesis.
- **Goal:** Use the learned model for efficient and accurate long-term forecasting and planning.
- **Key Benefits:**
  - Faster training (in epochs)
  - Lower compounding errors
  - Improved data efficiency
